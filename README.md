## Gemini integration (Ask Kimchi)
- `app.js` calls Gemini API from the browser in Ask Kimchi.
- Paste your key into `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `app.js` before publishing. The key is public on GitHub Pages; monitor quota and rotate it if exposed.
- `chemistry-book-chunks.json` contains extracted text chunks from Chemistry-Ar-EB-part1.pdf and is searched locally to provide relevant textbook context.
- Upload `index.html`, `platform.html`, `app.js`, `style.css`, and `chemistry-book-chunks.json` together to the same Pages root.
